# Structured-product-project

## Objective of the Course
The goal of this course is to create an application that assists a structured product manager in their daily tasks.

## Key Concepts
A structured product is a "formula fund." Each team handles a specific "formula."

A formula fund is a contract allowing the holder (the client who purchased the fund at its inception) to receive an amount at the end date based on market conditions. Holders may also receive "dividends" at interim dates, which are also contingent on market conditions.

The issuer (often a bank) must ensure they can pay the promised amounts to fund holders, particularly at the fund's closing date, without needing to borrow. They must invest the initial contribution in a carefully chosen portfolio of financial instruments that guarantees the promised amount by the closing date.

Manager's Role
The fund manager is responsible for managing this portfolio and must regularly publish the fund's net asset value (NAV), indicating the buyback price for the fund's shares.

## Decision Support Tool Requirements
The decision support tool should:

Display the portfolioâ€™s holdings, including instrument names, quantity, current prices (in both the fund's currency and foreign currencies if applicable), total invested amount, and an updated total portfolio value.

Provide an updated assessment of the fund's NAV.

Offer insights on potential portfolio rebalancing.
